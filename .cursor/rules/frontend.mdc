# Frontend Development Rules

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling (no custom CSS unless absolutely necessary)
- Framer Motion for animations

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Component names: PascalCase (e.g., `CostDashboard.jsx`)
- Keep components small and focused (KISS principle)
- Type safety with PropTypes or TypeScript

## Project Structure
- Components in `frontend/src/components/`
- Pages/views in `frontend/src/pages/`
- Utilities in `frontend/src/utils/`

## Development
- This is not the priority—backend first
- Build frontend only after backend is validated
